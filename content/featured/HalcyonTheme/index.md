During my time working for a Stealth Mode Startup, I singlehandedly designed and hosted the website for the company. I utilized SquareSpace to come up with a website design, and then modified the HTML/CSS code to fine-tune it. Afterwards, I used the online platform HostMonster, to host it on a custom domain.
