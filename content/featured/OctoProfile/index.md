I developed an automated testing suite to run diagnostics on the product and ensure its function before deployment.
The program is written in C++ and interfaces with a microprocessor that runs on code written in C. I designed a front-end GUI to test all the functions of the sensor and save a debug log of the results. 

Prior to this, each test was manually done one by one, and my program became incorporated to greatly expedite their testing process. Note that some of the source code is confidential, but the program itself is readily available in the links provided.
