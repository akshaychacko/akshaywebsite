For a class final project, I worked to write a program that used Natural Language Processing to auto generate country music song lyrics in Python. This program would train itself on a library of country music song lyrics by splitting these lyrics into different phrase models (such as bigrams and trigrams). These phrase models are then combined based on user-defined grammatical rules on how they should go together to form sentences of new lyrics in the structure of a country song (ie. verse, chorus, bridge).
&nbsp;
Lastly, the program utilized the Tweepy library to tweet the song lyrics via the Twitter API.
