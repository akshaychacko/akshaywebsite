A web app for visualizing the concentrations of certain pollutants in the United States. Written in R, an input CSV file is turned into a visualization via the Plotly library, then hosted on a server using the Shinyapps environment. This app is beneficial for environmental analysis because we can devise plans for improvement based off the pollutant's trends and causes.
