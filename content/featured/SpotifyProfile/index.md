For a class final project, I worked with a group to write a program that used Natural Language Processing to auto generate song lyrics in Python. This program would train itself on a library of country music song lyrics by splitting these lyrics into different phrase models (such as bigrams and trigrams). These phrase models are then combined based on user-defined grammatical rules on how they should go together to form sentences of new lyrics. Also utilizes these grammatical rules to form the structure of a country song (ie. verse, chorus, bridge).

Lastly, the program utilized the Tweepy library to tweet the song lyrics via the Twitter API.
