For a class final project, I worked with a group to write a program that used Natural Language Processing to auto generate song lyrics in Python. This program would train itself on a library of country music song lyrics by splitting these lyrics into different phrase models (such as bigrams and trigrams). These phrase models were then combined in various ways to fit the structure of an average country song.
Lastly, the program utilized the Tweepy library to tweet the song lyrics via the Twitter API.
